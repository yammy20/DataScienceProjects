This is a project whose purpose is to predict if a loan will get approved or not. The data is split into test data and training data, so there is no need to do a split.
The process for this project was more complicated than the previous Iris Data set. There is need for null imputation for the training set to be used for predicting. 
I went a little deeper than may be expected with the imputation of the null values. Some I imputed based on the relationship of other columns and the probabilities of thier values. Others I just used one of the descriptive statistcs. 
The projects then has some Exploratory Data Analysis of the imputed train data, some dimensionality reduction, and then uses Logistic Regression for the prediction.
